In this project, I learned how to transform a monolith system into a microservice architecture, which has always puzzled me. 

From monolith to microservices: A journey of transformation:

Initial Setup: Transitioned from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture using webhooks in a basic setup without a message broker.
Enhancements: Integrated a message broker and containerized the system with Docker for improved efficiency and scalability.
Deployment: Achieved continuous deployment on AWS, bringing the project to a cutting-edge level of automation and reliability.


Data consistency checks have not been performed. Only attempting to create a microservices scenario has been aimed at transitioning from monolith to microservices.
